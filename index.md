### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was particularly memorable to me because I found the process of getting all of the numbers and equations interesting. Getting to put in my own months, days, and years and having the program calculate it was fascinating. Although I felt the code was less optimized than it should be, the fact that it still works flawless is a win in my books.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites in particular due to the process it took to complete it. My partner and I were constantly going back and forth about possible solutions, ultimately relying on his notes with some of my corrections. The relief of finally finding the correct line of code after going back and forth was gratifying, and was definitely an experience of all time.

* Lab 9

    Of recent memory, one of the labs that stuck with me was Lab 9 Part 2. This lab is similar in concept to Lab 8 Part 2, what with the writing code to check a separate file. Seeing my partner go at it while I was able to contribute by correcting small mistakes here and there definitely helped me improve my skills as a navigator.
